      <h2 class="title">How it works</h2>
      <p>Every day a new political current event or topic is chosen. The team at SHIFT then curates a list of nonpartisan and partisan news sources so those unaware of the issue can become informed of the topic, and then matches users in a chat room with someone who holds different political views.

      <br><br>

      The users reward points after the chat is completed based on how well their partner understood and listened to their viewpoints, similar to like reviewing an uber driver. Those with the most points are represented on the leaderboard and are given special badges.</p>

      <h1 class="title">About us</h1>
      <p class="content">Shiftâ€™s goal is to unite people of differing backgrounds and allow for open discussions of contradicting viewpoints. Through the use of guided chats and incentives, people are encouraged to engage in respectful discourse that leads to the sharing of new and interesting ideas. 
      
      <br>
      <br>

      Thus, Shift intends to influence society in a positive way that leads to more open-minded individuals with informed perspectives.  Shift was founded at Code Day, Pittsburgh in 2017 by 
      Richard Xu, Thomas Dicarlo, and Justin Kramer.
