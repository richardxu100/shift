      <h1 class="title">About us</h1>
      <p class="content">Shiftâ€™s goal is to unite people of differing backgrounds and allow for open discussions of contradicting viewpoints. Through the use of guided chats and incentives, people are encouraged to engage in respectful discourse that leads to the sharing of new and interesting ideas.

      Thus, Shift intends to influence society in a positive way that leads to more open-minded individuals with informed perspectives.  Shift was founded at Code Day, Pittsburgh in 2017 by 
      Richard Xu, Thomas Dicarlo, and Justin Kramer.
